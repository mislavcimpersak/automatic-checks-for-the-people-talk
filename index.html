					- This talk was in the making in my head for the past two years.
					- And of course, really in the making for the past three days.
					- But it is a strugle I'm dealing with my whole development carreer.
					- Ever since I started writing code I was always looking not just if my code is beautiful from
					machine perspective but also beautiful from sort of a bird's eye view.
					- Ok, maybe not my first Pascal programs, but definitly my first HTML pages written 16-17 years ago.
					- And those were troubling times to "do development" especially in a small backwater village in
					Zagorje.

					- I mostly learned from one crappy book that I borrowed.
					- It looked something like this. This is not the book, but it isn't too far off.
					- It was confusing time.
					- HTML 4 was out, but also XHTML 1.
					- You should be using CSS for everything including for layout, and not tables anymore, but maybe
					tables?
					- I had no mentor, I only had the book and the internet.

					- yeah... dial up internet.
					- I used to connect, open a bunch of pages, saved them one way or another,
					- then disconnect and read through the materials.

					- My parents were not happy.

					- and pressed F5 endlessly.
					- More often than not I was horiffied how badly structed things are,
					- how difficult the code is for me to read.
					- But one page was different than the others.

					- CSS Zen Garden
					- Side note:
					- For those of you who never heard of it, CSS Zen Garden is a page started in 2003 which was used as
					a demonstration what can be accomplished through CSS based design.
					- The idea was that you take that page's HTML and without changing a single HTML element, create a
					totally visually different web page using only CSS.
					- It wasn't only the pages, the designs that were beautiful, it was all the code as well.
					- So neat and clean.
					- Spacings and indentations were meaningfull.
					- CSS was grouped.
					- I could read even the most complex example because the code had a certain flow that the authors
					created.
					- I started reading about code style guides and through out time made my own rules and I was always
					busy adjusting them.
					- And list of my rules grew.

					- In my college days I did some ... you know ... college is the time to experiment right?
					- Don't judge me.
					- I did some ... PHP.

					- I was the guy in group projects that was changing others code because:
					- whitespace is important!
					- functions are camelcase!
					- variables are snakecase!
					- properties are camelcase!
					- classes are also camelcase, but with the initial hump as well (Pascal case)
					- Looking at it now, I'm not even sure those rules made sense.
					- And also, apparently I was doing very anal code reviews before I even heard about code reviews.

					- Fast forward few years and I'm doing Python.
					- Life is good.
					- We have PEP8.
					- So I'm using it.
					- My other team members are not.
					- And they are not wrong.
					- It's sometimes horible to write and produces code that is even less readable.
					- Then, we also have PyChecker, PyLint, PyFlakes...
					- So many possible rules can be set and even when they are set in some guide book in some wiki or a
					readme, they are hard to enforce.
					- And let me tell you:
					- If they are not enforced automatically, they are not happening.
