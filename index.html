					- This talk was in the making in my head for the past two years.
					- And of course, really in the making for the past three days.
					- But it is a strugle I'm dealing with my whole development carreer.
					- Ever since I started writing code I was always looking not just if my code is beautiful from
					machine perspective but also beautiful from sort of a bird's eye view.
					- Ok, maybe not my first Pascal programs, but definitly my first HTML pages written 16-17 years ago.
					- And those were troubling times to "do development" especially in a small backwater village in
					Zagorje.

					- I mostly learned from one crappy book that I borrowed.
					- It looked something like this. This is not the book, but it isn't too far off.
					- It was confusing time.
					- HTML 4 was out, but also XHTML 1.
					- You should be using CSS for everything including for layout, and not tables anymore, but maybe
					tables?
					- I had no mentor, I only had the book and the internet.

					- CSS Zen Garden
					- Side note:
					- For those of you who never heard of it, CSS Zen Garden is a page started in 2003 which was used as
					a demonstration what can be accomplished through CSS based design.
					- The idea was that you take that page's HTML and without changing a single HTML element, create a
					totally visually different web page using only CSS.
					- It wasn't only the pages, the designs that were beautiful, it was all the code as well.
					- So neat and clean.
					- Spacings and indentations were meaningfull.
					- CSS was grouped.
					- I could read even the most complex example because the code had a certain flow that the authors
					created.
					- I started reading about code style guides and through out time made my own rules and I was always
					busy adjusting them.
					- And list of my rules grew.

					- In my college days I did some ... you know ... college is the time to experiment right?
					- Don't judge me.
					- I did some ... PHP.

					- I was the guy in group projects that was changing others code because:
					- whitespace is important!
					- functions are camelcase!
					- variables are snakecase!
					- properties are camelcase!
					- classes are also camelcase, but with the initial hump as well (Pascal case)
					- Looking at it now, I'm not even sure those rules made sense.
					- And also, apparently I was doing very anal code reviews before I even heard about code reviews.

					- Fast forward few years and I'm doing Python.
					- Life is good.
					- We have PEP8.
					- So I'm using it.
					- My other team members are not.
					- And they are not wrong.
					- It's sometimes horible to write and produces code that is even less readable.
					- Then, we also have PyChecker, PyLint, PyFlakes...
					- So many possible rules can be set and even when they are set in some guide book in some wiki or a
					readme, they are hard to enforce.
					- And let me tell you:
					- If they are not enforced automatically, they are not happening.

					- Enter the first line of defense:

					- It's "A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks."
					- Hooks are small scripts that are run on every commit to automatically point out issues in code.
					- Some can even modify the code if it's safe to do so.

			<section data-background-image="media/insights.dice.com_Programming-Language-Popularity.jpg">

					- The example given on the project web site best describes it:
					- You are working on a static page, but you want to lint you SCSS files with scss-lint which is
					written in Ruby.
					- Using pre-commit there is no need for a special gem file or for installing the linter manually.
					- Pre-commit takes care of installing it initially and running the liner on each commit.

				<h4>One commit</h4>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- First: do it in one commit. Like pulling a bandage.
					- This is the way some major open sources projects did it with Black.
					- True, it messes up your git history in a way,
					- because now all the code will be on the same last commit.
					- You can still go down the history and see the real author, but now you've added an extra step.

				<h3>Formatting</h3>

				<h4>Boy scout rule</h4>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Second - the boy scout rule - everything you touch, you leave it behind nicer than you found it.
					- You are working on let's say logic.py,
					- you add one import, but the rest of them are in random order.
					- Re-order them and commit it like that.
				</aside>

			<section>
				<h3>Checks</h3>
				<div class="fragment fade-in">
					<img src="media/prospector_warning.png" alt="" class="plain">
				</div>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- For checks:
					- add it as a stage in CI, just a stage that can fail.
					- The psychological effect of people seeing this red mark might encourage them to fix it slowly, one
					by one.
					- Hopefully.
					- Once it's established as a common practice make it a CI step that will break the build.

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- All the checks you use, they should not be set in stone.
					- And you should be able to add more if the need arises.
					- In most of the teams I was working in they were added gradually into the project, each after some
					discussion.
					- So the check and the rule it enforces is a group decision.
					- Not an autocratic one.
